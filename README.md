**Overview**

This project implements a Markov Chain–based text generator in C.
The program reads a text file, builds a Markov Chain from the words in the file, and then generates random “tweets” based on word transition frequencies.

Each word is treated as a state in the Markov Chain, and transitions between words are weighted by how often they appear consecutively in the input text.

**How It Works**

The program reads an input text file and splits it into words.

Each unique word is stored once in a database (linked list).

For every word, the program keeps a frequency list of words that follow it.

Tweets are generated by:

Selecting a random starting word that does not end with a period (.)

Repeatedly choosing the next word according to transition frequencies

Stopping when a word ends with a period or when the maximum length is reached

Program Structure

linked_list.c / linked_list.h
Implements a simple singly linked list used to store all Markov nodes.

markov_chain.c / markov_chain.h
Contains the Markov Chain logic:

**Database creation**

Frequency list management

Random word selection

Tweet generation

Memory cleanup

tweets_generator.c
Contains the main function:

Parses command-line arguments

Reads the input file

Builds the Markov Chain

Generates and prints tweets

**Compilation**

Compile the program using gcc:

gcc tweets_generator.c markov_chain.c linked_list.c -o tweets_generator

Usage
./tweets_generator <seed> <num_of_tweets> <path_to_text_file> [max_words]

Arguments

seed – Seed for the random number generator

num_of_tweets – Number of tweets to generate

path_to_text_file – Path to the input text file

max_words (optional) – Maximum number of words to read from the file

If omitted, the entire file is used

Example
./tweets_generator 42 5 corpus.txt 1000


This command generates 5 tweets using up to 1000 words from corpus.txt.

Output

The program prints the generated tweets to standard output in the following format:

Tweet 1: <generated text>
Tweet 2: <generated text>
...


Each tweet contains at least two words and ends either with a period or when the maximum length is reached.

Memory Management

All dynamically allocated memory is properly freed before program termination.

The Markov Chain owns all allocated words and frequency lists.

The program avoids memory leaks and double frees.

**Notes**

The program uses only standard C libraries.

Randomness is controlled using srand(seed) for reproducible results.

Words ending with . are treated as sentence-ending states.
